# snake-game 1.0.1

## Complile: 
```
gcc -snake.c -o snake.o
```
## Run: 
```
./snake.o
```
One of my very first big (sort of big) projects in C, tried copying the Snake game available on Nokia keypad phones back in the day.

## Key Features
• Implemented two game modes - Normal & the Box mode. 

• The speed of the snake increases as you score more points.

• Interactive text colors and a score counter.


Furthermore, I would also like to implement obstacles and a level system in this game in future. 

`Certain libraries used in this program is only available for linux based systems`
